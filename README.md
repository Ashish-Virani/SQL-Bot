# SQL-Bot
SQL Bot is an intelligent application that allows you to query databases using plain English. Built with Python, Streamlit, and a locally-run LLM, it translates natural language questions into executable SQL queries and explains complex SQL in simple terms. It supports direct database connections and file uploads (CSV/XLSX).
